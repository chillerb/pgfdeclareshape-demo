# pgfdeclareshape-demo

> A brief demo how to use pgfdeclareshape.

## About this Project

In `pgf/TikZ`, you can declare new shapes in addition to rectangles and circles using `pgfdeclareshape`.
However, TikZ can be frustrating and it took me quite some time to figure out how `pgfdeclareshape` is used correctly.
Maybe this example can be helpful and save you some time.

For more information, see the TikZ manual:
